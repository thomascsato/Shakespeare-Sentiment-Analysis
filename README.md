# Shakespeare-Sentiment-Analysis

Final project for ENGL 341 Shakespeare at Willamette University.  The pdf for the final paper will be uploaded here, along with all of the code that was used in the process of this project.
"Shakespeare Automated.Rmd" is where the automation comes in, with the functions for all the word included.  This would be considered the finished product in terms of code, but the more thorough design process and analysis is in the paper.
